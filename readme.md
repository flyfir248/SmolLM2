# SmolLM2 Interactive Streamlit App (360M)

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

This repository hosts a **Streamlit app** powered by the **SmolLM2-Instruct 360M model**, a lightweight pre-trained language model for interactive text generation. The app is designed to generate human-like responses based on user inputs, making it a great tool for text-based tasks like brainstorming, creative writing, or question-answering.

---

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Pre-trained Model Integration**: Utilizes the 360M version of SmolLM2-Instruct from Hugging Face.
- **Interactive Prompt Input**: Users can enter prompts and receive AI-generated responses in real-time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust model generation parameters such as:
  - `Max Tokens`
  - `Temperature`
  - `Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)`
- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Uses FP16 for reduced memory footprint.
  - Automatically leverages GPU when available.
- **Explanation Section**: Learn how the app works with detailed insights provided in the UI.

## üìã **Setup and Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library installed.
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and Hugging Face's `transformers` package installed.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smollm2-app.git
   cd smollm2-app
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

1. **Model Loading**:
   - Downloads the 360M SmolLM2 model checkpoint from Hugging Face on the first run.
   - Caches the model to avoid repeated downloads.

2. **Input and Interaction**:
   - Enter a prompt in the text box.

   - Fine-tune generation parameters using the sidebar sliders.
    
3. **Response Generation**:
   - The app processes the input prompt, generates text using the model, and displays the output in real time.

## üñ•Ô∏è **UI Layout**
- **Main Page**:
  - Prompt input text area.
  - Output section displaying AI-generated responses.
- **Sidebar**:
  - Model parameter sliders for `Max Tokens`, `Temperature`, and `Top-p`.
  - About section with model details and a link to the Hugging Face model card.
- **Explanation Section**:
  - An overview of how the app works, optimized for user understanding.

## üìö **Model Information**
This app is powered by the [SmolLM2-Instruct 360M model](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct), a lightweight pre-trained language model designed for instruction-based tasks. It balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for applications requiring fast responses and moderate hardware resources.

## üí° **Customizing the App**
Feel free to modify the following:
- **Model Checkpoint**: Replace the default checkpoint with another Hugging Face model.
- **UI Elements**: Add more controls, explanations, or styling to enhance the user experience.
